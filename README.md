<h2> Statistics and Machine Learning with Scala, Spark and SQL</h2>

I take a dataset of recorded tornado events across the United States and do some basic analysis. I start by loading in the data and doing some cleaning/filtering. Then I find which years and which states saw the most 
tornadoes and the worst tornadoes. The program ends by doing some linear regression on the number of tornadoes seen each each year.

The next thing is a classification task. Some events are recorded as tornados but their Fujita Scale rating is unknown, so I plan to use the date, property damage, number of people injured and the number of fatalities
as features for a neural network to predict the magnitude of the tornado (Fujita Scale value).
